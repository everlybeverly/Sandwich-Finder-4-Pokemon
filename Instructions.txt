Every Sparkling Sandwich Power Combination can be found in Recipe_List-Sparkling_Complete.txt
Just ctrl f 'power, 3, type'
	Example:
		egg, 3
		raid, 3, poison

For the less tech savy:
Open up the text docs
Ctrl F powers you are looking for
Keep in mind not every power/level/type combination has been found (and some do not exist)
	Do not expect to find an egg 3, title 3 normal, raid 1 poison for example

For python users or people who might want to become one:
This is a command line project (I really don't got gui making time)
Use the Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py to find the desired effects
Again not every combination exists
It takes arguments in the order power level type
You can specify 1, 2 or 3 distinct powers in almost any order
	Egg DOES NOT get a type and MUST be listed first
	Examples:
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py egg 1
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py egg 2 catching 1 water
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py egg 3 sparkling 3 water title 3 water
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py teensy 1 poison
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py teensy 2 ice title 2 psychic
		path\Sandwhich_Recipe_Finder.py teensy 3 psychic title 3 psychic sparkling 3 psychic
	powers ---> [egg, catching, exp, item, raid, title, sparkling, humungo, teensy, encounter]
	levels ---> [1, 2, 3]
	types --->  [fire, grass, water, electric, normal, ground, rock, psychic, ghost, flying, ice, bug, fighting, poison, dragon, dark, steel, fairy]
        
Its possible some combinations have not been discovered yet.  I got what I needed out of this but I also have a 9-5 so I don't know how often Ill be updating.
If you see improvements feel free to take this and run with it.  Code optimization was never really something I had to deal with in under/grad school or work.
